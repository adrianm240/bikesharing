# bikesharing
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to analyze bikesharing data in New York City to identify insights for a potential opening of a similar program in a different city. The project requires cleaning some of the data using Python Pandas and visualizing the findings using Tablaeu.

## Project Summary
The project identified the following key insights:
- Most customer's bike rides last less than 30 minutes and many return their bike rentals around 8am and 6pm on weekdays.
- While males rent more bikes, gender does not appear to be a major factor in determining bike duration or stop times.
- Subscriber's have much higher bike rental counts than regular customers.
- Bike rental counts are much larger in the urban commercial/business district of New York City.

Future analysis/vizualization ideas:
- Analyzing the average length of use a bike gets before needing a repair.
- Analyzing the average distance a bike renter travels.
